# Gradient Descent Concepts

## Overview

This project explores the behavior of several optimization algorithms — Gradient Descent (GD), Backtracking GD, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)— on a objective function. It is divided onto 2 notebooks : gradient_descent_in_depth and gradient_descent_summary_and_experiments. 


## Usage
Run all experiments following the order specified in the index.
